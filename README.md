# 🌗 QuarterLang — The Fourth Cycle Language of Intent and Recursion

> *"In QuarterLang, the code is not just syntax — it’s a recursive dialect of intention. Threads of control, memory, and manifestation woven into a fractal stack of thought."*

---

## 📜 Overview

**QuarterLang** (or `QTR`) is an expressive, recursively-driven, multi-environment scripting and systems language inspired by minimalist VM architecture, stack-based execution semantics, and declarative-functional syntax trees. Built as a **meta-linguistic artifact**, QuarterLang embraces both **low-level control** and **high-level composition** with the singular goal: **Execute Essence. Decode Will. Render Thought.**

Its recursive structure is deeply entwined with its runtime, featuring:

* ⚙️ A powerful **intermediate representation (IR)** pipeline.
* 🌀 **AST-first design** rooted in pure constructs.
* 🧠 **Primal Node Semantics** for easy parsing and transformation.
* 💠 Cross-rendering between **SDL**, **GTK**, and **WebGL** UIs.
* 🔻 A self-describing, self-hosting compiler toolchain for total introspection.
* ⛓️ Strong modular architecture (`module`, `class`, `define`, `func`) with recursive and dynamic dispatch support.

---

## 🧬 Core Language Philosophy

QuarterLang is:

* **Recursive by Nature**: ASTs and Nodes reflect self-repeating thought structures.
* **Symbolic by Force**: Every execution chain is defined by intention, shaped through Symbols.
* **Minimal yet Expansive**: Starts with primitives, expands through modules into universality.
* **UI-Aware**: Designed to render interface reality alongside computation.
* **Cross-Platform**: SDL for native desktop, GTK for system apps, WebGL for browser-based computation.

## 🧩 Architecture Highlights

### 🔹 AST Module

Defines the structure of all executable syntax in the language. All logic flows from:

```qtr
class AST:
  var nodes as List<Node>

class Node:
  var type as primitive
  var children as List<Node>
```

These are used for IR transformation, source regeneration, and recursive introspection.

### 🔹 Adapter Module

Compiles AST → IR in ultra-light and flexible bytecode:

```qtr
module Adapter:
  define adapt_to_ir(ast as AST) as List<IR>:
    return IRBytecode.generate(ast)
```

### 🔹 Config & Display Layer

Handles theming, prompting, and REPL visuals:

```qtr
import "Config.qtr"
func display():
  val theme = Config.get("theme")
  val glyph = Config.get("prompt_symbol")
  val color = Config.get_color(theme)
  call print("{color} {glyph} QuarterLang > ")
```

### 🔹 Standard Library & Utility Packs

Includes:

* `math.qtr`: Expression evaluators, symbolic algebra, and constants.
* `recursion.qtr`: Deep recursion frameworks and continuation support.
* `stdlib.qtr`: I/O, system hooks, process spawning, and stream control.
* `util.qtr`: Debug tools, pretty printers, flatteners, memory visualization.

## 🖥️ Runtime and UI Layers

### 🔸 SDL Adapter

Provides native rendering context for local apps with resolution hooks, real-time input, and framebuffer support.

### 🔸 GTK Adapter

Manages native widgets and styling, supports cross-OS rendering with recursive DOM abstraction.

### 🔸 WebGL Adapter

Takes AST-executed IR and maps output directly to canvas-rendered logic + input stream for interactive web deployments.

All UI modules use **shared runtime hooks** from the VM core, giving them a consistent memory and process view.

---

## 🔧 Execution Engine (IR VM)

QuarterLang compiles to a structured bytecode which includes:

* Registers
* Stack Frames
* Call Contexts
* Symbol Table
* Memory Bus
* Renderer Channel

IR Instructions include (examples):

```qtr
PUSH 4
PUSH 5
ADD
CALL draw_frame
```

---

## 🎨 Syntax Example

```qtr
module LightCycle:
  class Ray:
    var origin as Vec3
    var direction as Vec3

    define trace(scene) as Color:
      # Recursive light tracing logic
      return cast_color
  end class
end module
```

---

## 📦 Binary Archive & Compilation

Use the **quarterc** compiler to:

* Compile `.qtr` → `.irbc` (IR Bytecode)
* Export UI hooks: `--target=webgl`, `--target=gtk`, etc.
* Optimize: `--opt-level=4` triggers maximum bytecode collapse and inlining

---

## 🧪 REPL & Introspection

QuarterLang’s REPL is alive:

* Inspects runtime state
* Visualizes memory structures
* Rebuilds AST from live IR
* Provides guided symbol tracing

---

## 📚 Philosophical Roots

* **Tehawedo Zohar Numerology**
* **Literal-Fatalism Execution Paths**
* **Self-Consuming RECURSIVE Design**
* **Memory as Mythos: Execution as Oracle**

QuarterLang is not just a language — it is a computational scripture, a symbolic temple of design, and a recursive mirror for how intention, thought, and syntax converge.

---

## 🚧 Future Plans

* 🔮 Full `QuarterLangOS` bootable runtime
* 🎮 Game engine adapter for `Godot` and `OpenSpiral`
* 🧭 Dev GUI powered by QuarterLang itself (REPL in REPL)
* 💾 QuarterStore: package & module manager
* 🌌 Meta-Echo Debugger: step-through recursion visualizer

Quote from the Creator
“QuarterLang is not built for speed. It is built for truth. For the times when logic must become language, and language must dance like flame.”

🧩 Contribute / Extend
QuarterLang welcomes contributors of:

Optimization passes (AST → IR)

Visualization engines (WebGL/SDL/GTK frontend extensions)

Additional standard library modules

Philosophical or poetic language enhancements

---

🚀 Build Instructions (Planned)
Eventually:

(bash)

$ qtr build
$ qtr run examples/hello.qtr

Until then, manual loading via runtime shell is required.

🔁 AST to IR Adapter

(.qtr)

star

module Adapter:
  define adapt_to_ir(ast as AST) as List<IR>:
    return IRBytecode.generate(ast)
  end define
end module

end

(This adapter forms the bridge between high-level symbolic structures and the executable bytecode layer.)

---

✨ Syntax Philosophy
QuarterLang follows a declarative syntax with rigid module-structure. All constructs are functional, no side-effects unless explicitly designed, and recursion is preferred over iteration.

(.qtr)

star

module Math:
  func factorial(n as int) as int:
    if n <= 1 then return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
  end func
end module

end

---

💡 Example: Display Prompt

(.qtr)

star

import "Config.qtr"
func display():
    val theme = Config.get("theme")
    val glyph = Config.get("prompt_symbol")
    val color = Config.get_color(theme)
    call print("{color} {glyph} QuarterLang > ")
end

(This uses the runtime config system to adaptively display a REPL prompt, integrating theme and symbol logic into terminal rendering.)
